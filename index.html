<h2 style="font-family:verdana">General Information</h2>
<p>I grew up in Lynchburg Virgina and was born on November 29, 1998 to Paul Feinman and Paula Ryan, and I have one older sister named Emma who is currently a senior at the University of Virginia. I am about 5'10" with <font color="green">green</font> eyes and brown hair, and look more like my father than my mother.<p>
<h3 style=font-family:verdana>About Me</h3>
<p>I am just your average college freshman right now from Virginia. I grew up loving sports, movies, and even have a slight interest in reading books. As of now my favorite movie is <i>The Usual Suspects</i> which was directed by Bryan Singer, this is the best suspense and thriller movie I have ever seen that has one of the best plot twists of all time and I highly recommend watching. If Iâ€™m not at the theater for the newest movie my favorite hobby is playing pick-up basketball or soccer. The best part about playing in a local park or facility is that it allows you to meet new people you normally would have no connection with and allows you to create a bond with them over the shared love for the sport. </p>
